# Sales Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates a comprehensive sales data analysis using both SQL and Power BI tools. The goal is to analyze sales transactions, customer behavior, and product performance across different countries and cities. 

Using SQL, we perform data aggregation, ranking with Common Table Expressions (CTEs), and generate insights such as top-selling products per country and total revenue by region. The Power BI component visualizes this data through interactive dashboards, maps, and KPIs to support business decision-making.
