# Sales Data Analysis Project Documentation

## 1. Project Overview
This project involves comprehensive sales data analysis using SQL and Power BI. The objective is to extract meaningful business insights from transactional sales data by performing data aggregation, ranking, and visualization to support data-driven decision-making.

The dataset includes sales transactions, customer details, product catalog, and geographical sales territories. The analysis covers revenue calculation, top-performing products, regional sales trends, and customer segmentation.

## 2. About the Project
The project is structured into two primary components:

**SQL Analysis:** Utilizing advanced SQL queries, including Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and window functions such as `RANK()`, to aggregate and rank sales data. Key analyses performed include:

- Calculating total revenue per country and city.
- Ranking the top products by sales revenue within each country.
- Identifying high-value customers and segmenting data by geographic regions.

**Power BI Reporting:** Building interactive dashboards and reports to visualize and explore the processed data. The Power BI solution consists of three report pages:

- **Dashboard:** Featuring KPIs, trend analyses for monthly orders and revenue through line and bar charts, and product comparisons.
- **Maps:** Visualizing sales orders geographically by country using bubble maps to highlight spatial sales concentrations.
- **Customer Analysis:** Presenting KPIs, top customers by revenue, detailed tables of orders and revenue, enabling granular insights into customer behavior.

## 3. Business Insights

### 3.1 Revenue Analysis by Geography
- **Country-Level Revenue:** The United States and Australia emerge as the leading markets by total sales revenue, reflecting significant business opportunities in these regions.
- **City-Level Sales:** London and Paris top the list of cities generating the highest sales volumes, indicating critical urban centers for strategic focus.

### 3.2 Product Performance
Product rankings reveal country-specific top sellers, with models such as “Mountain-200 Black” and “Road-150 Red” consistently driving revenue.

These insights enable informed inventory management and targeted marketing efforts tailored to regional demand.

### 3.3 Customer Segmentation and KPIs
Analysis of customer revenue and order volume identifies key accounts to prioritize for retention and upselling.

Monthly order and revenue trend comparisons expose seasonal patterns and highlight growth opportunities.

Power BI’s dynamic visuals provide drill-down capability, empowering stakeholders to explore data interactively.

### 3.4 Geographic Sales Distribution
Bubble maps effectively communicate regional sales density, revealing high-potential and underserved markets.

These geographic insights assist in optimizing distribution logistics and regional marketing campaigns.

## 4. Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effective integration of robust SQL data processing with Power BI’s advanced visualization capabilities to deliver actionable business intelligence. The insights derived provide a clear understanding of revenue drivers, customer behavior, and regional sales dynamics.

Combining SQL’s analytical power with Power BI’s interactive reporting equips organizations with the tools needed to make strategic, data-driven decisions, ultimately enhancing sales performance and customer engagement.
